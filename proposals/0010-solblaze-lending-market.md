# SBGP-0010: SolBlaze Lending Market
SolBlaze would like to propose the creation of a custom lending market on Kamino with incentives to grow lending liquidity for SolBlaze-specific assets.

## Proposed Change
Kamino Lend v2 has allowed for the creation of custom lending markets on Kamino outside of the main market, such as the JLP Market, Jito Market, Ethena Market, and Altcoins Market.

We have partnered with Kamino and their risk management partner Allez Labs to develop a SolBlaze Market that will initially support bSOL and SOL deposits with the possibility of future expansion for other SolBlaze-specific assets.

The market will also be integrated with Kamino's other features such as Kamino Multiply, and the isolated nature of the market will ensure more favorable borrowing rates for assets in the SolBlaze Market.

As part of the launch for this new market, we have worked with Allez Labs to create an incentives structure which will help bring in SOL deposits, which SolBlaze users can borrow against their bSOL collateral.

Based on the projections that have been modeled by Allez Labs, the optimal amount of incentives for the pool is 250m BLZE over the first 2 months of the incentives campaign, which should attract significant deposits into the lending market.

## Implementation Details
The 250m BLZE will be transferred to Kamino after the passing of this proposal so that they can deploy the incentives when the lending market launches.

## Voting
Yes - 250m BLZE from DAO fee revenues will be used to incentivize deposits into the SolBlaze Market on Kamino

No - DAO fee revenues will not be used to incentivize deposits

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, we will send the initial incentives budget to Kamino and gear up for the launch of the lending market.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
