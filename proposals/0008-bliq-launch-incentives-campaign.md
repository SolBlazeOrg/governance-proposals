# SBGP-0008: Bliq Launch Incentives Campaign
SolBlaze would like to propose a Bliq launch incentives campaign of 200m locked BLZE to rapidly grow Bliq TVL to 1m+ SOL.

## Proposed Change
SolBlaze is gearing up to launch Bliq within the next few days and would like to utilize the DAO's BLZE warchest to strategically incentivize the growth of this new protocol.

The DAO fee revenues account currently has 1b BLZE, and we would like to earmark 200m BLZE (<20%) from that account for the purposes of incentivizing adoption of Bliq.

At the current estimates, a Bliq TVL of 1m SOL will result in a higher yearly revenue for the DAO compared to the cost of this proposal, and the locked nature of the BLZE incentives will encourage long-term participation in the SolBlaze ecosystem.

The incentives system will be based on TVL milestones, so if Bliq does not reach 1m SOL in TVL within the incentives timeframe, the remaining BLZE will be returned to the DAO.

## Implementation Details
The incentives campaign of 200m locked BLZE will be launched after the passing of this proposal, and 200m BLZE will be transferred from the DAO fees account to a DAO grants account which will issue the locked BLZE rewards.

## Voting
Yes - 200m BLZE from DAO fee revenues will be used to initiate a Bliq launch incentives campaign in accordance with this proposal

No - DAO fee revenues will not be used to initiate a Bliq launch incentives campaign

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the Bliq launch incentives campaign will be activated.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
