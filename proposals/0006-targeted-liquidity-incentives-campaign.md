# SBGP-0006: Targeted Liquidity Incentives Campaign
SolBlaze would like to propose a targeted liquidity incentives campaign to defend bSOL dominance within DeFi.

## Proposed Change
Currently, the DAO fee revenues (365m+ BLZE) that were primarily built up over the course of the last three months have not yet been utilized.

However, as other stake pool providers such as Marinade and Jito begin utilizing their DAO treasuries for their own targeted liquidity incentives campaigns, it's critically important for SolBlaze to step up and initiate our own campaign to defend and grow liquidity.

SolBlaze is proposing that 120m BLZE be utilized in a few key areas with concentrated incentives to grow liquidity for bSOL and BLZE over the next month. The main focuses of this initial campaign will be bSOL-SOL and bSOL-BLZE liquidity, but a smaller percentage may be directed to other pairs such as bSOL-USDC for example.

This proposal does not create any new net inflation as it uses BLZE tokens that have already been in circulation rather than emissions of new or previously uncirculating tokens. It's also estimated (based on current values and historical averages) that the DAO will recoup this BLZE through protocol revenues within 1-2 months.

The importance of this campaign cannot be understated. It is absolutely vital for the SolBlaze DAO to deploy its war chest through targeted initiatives in order to compete on a more level playing field compared to other liquid staking protocols. Additionally, increased liquidity can lead to expanded access to further integrations as well as increased overall market efficiency.

## Implementation Details
Boosted emissions will be added to the relevant pools after the passing of this proposal for the duration of one month. After this period, the DAO can analyze the impacts of this initiative in growing liquidity and defending bSOL dominance in DeFi to see if further adjustments should be made.

## Voting
Yes - 120m BLZE from DAO fee revenues will be used to initiate a targeted liquidity incentives campaign in accordance with this proposal

No - DAO fee revenues will not be used to initiate a targeted liquidity incentives campaign

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the targeted liquidity incentives campaign will be activated.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
