# SBGP-0005: Community Mod Support
This is a humble proposal from the mods to you [the community], seeking support for the ongoing efforts of those dedicated to maintaining, moderating, and promoting our server/community.

Since our community's inception, mods have been unpaid and volunteering their time purely out of dedication to the Blazestake ecosystem; however, all of our mods have greater responsibilities as founders, developers, validators, and representatives to other communities as well - incentivizing this shared time/effort would be extremely helpful and appreciated.

This proposal has two primary goals:
* Pro-rate some form of back-reward from the time the mods were appointed.
* Allocate vesting contracts for our mods that reward-out every 3 months going forward

**_These mod-rewards would be in $blze and come from the SolBlaze treasury allocation (not impacting overall community rewards whatsoever)._**

Agreement on rates and rewards has already been reached between the mods and SolBlaze; however, we wish to do this the right way and set it to a proposal. Your consideration is greatly appreciated, and mods will continue to support the community regardless of how this proposal votes.

Thank you! :handshake:

## Rates/Implementation
The reward rate agreed upon by mods and SolBlaze was ~$2.5k/mo. This figure was established by taking the average of what mods from the other defi protocols are currently being paid and would be rewarded in $blze. This rate will be revaluated every 3-months and locked into a vesting contract - which will vest 1/3 each month for that period. The pro-rated rewards would be a one-time immediate distribution based on how long the mod has served the community. The formula used for the pro-rate and 3-month vesting contract will be the current 30-day avg price of $blze (beginning with what it is at the time of finalizing this proposal).

### Rate Formula (revaluated every 3 months)
Feb 21 @ 0.002900 (30 days ago)
Mar 21 @ 0.001775 (current)
Rate = 0.002338.

### First 3 Month Vesting Totals (based on above rate)
3 month total (across all mods): 16,039,349.87
  - Divide by <numMods(5)>: 3,207,869.97/mod (3-month total)
    - Divide by <numMonths(3)>: 1,069,289.99/mod (1-month total)


## Mods, Their Appointment Date, and Pro-Rate (based on above formula):
  - Amir (@amirkk1) | 2023-08-18 (7 mo) = 7,485,029.94
  - Celshade (@celshade) | 2023-08-18 (7 mo) = 7,485,029.94
  - Mst (@mst0000) | 2023-08-19 (7 mo) = 7,485,029.94
  - DanG (@dang9248) | 2023-08-19 (7 mo) = 7,485,029.94
  - Suckmyleghair (@suckmyleghair) | 2023-12-23 (3 mo) = 3,207,869.97

## Ongoing Responsibilities
  * Support users within the community by troubleshooting issues, responding to inquiries, providing general knowledge of our ecosystem, moderating the community, and assisting in tickets (to the extend allowed by server permissions).
  * Represent the community as an ambassador to the ecosystem - supporting bSOL publicly and attributing to its growth via community outreach
    - i.e. Mods have successfully onboarded several projects, validators, and communities who now stake their treasuries with and recommend their users towards bSOL - an outreach/goal which continues.
  * Maintain a presence in the server and community
  * Assist with the organization and preservation of blazestake information (to the extend allowed by server/site permissions).
  * etc
