# SBGP-0007: Sponsor Post-Breakpoint Event
SolBlaze would like to utilize DAO funds to sponsor a post-Breakpoint event, increasing SolBlaze visibility and adoption.

## Proposed Change
Currently, the DAO has a few hundred bSOL that were originally collected through an old fee mechanism and never utilized.

Since many other major protocols are sponsoring Breakpoint and post-Breakpoint events, it's critical that SolBlaze also sponsors an event to increase brand recognition and encourage developers to build on top of SolBlaze.

SolBlaze has finalized an exclusive agreement to be the primary sponsor of a prominent month-long builder-focused event with 300+ attendees that begins a few days after Breakpoint.

The cost of the sponsorship is $50k USDC and entails logos on marketing/videos/merch, sponsored workstations, dedicated hackathon track, highlight in recap video, on-site ambassadors to onboard builders to SolBlaze, and more!

## Implementation Details
330 bSOL ($50k at current prices + 10% margin for price movements) will be converted to $50k USDC for the purposes of funding this event sponsorship. The remainder of the bSOL in excess of $50k USDC will be returned back to the DAO.

## Voting
Yes - 330 bSOL from DAO treasury will be transferred to the funding wallet used for this event sponsorship, with the remainder of the bSOL in excess of $50k USDC returned back to the DAO treasury

No - DAO treasury will not be used to fund this event sponsorship

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the DAO treasury will be used to fund the event sponsorship.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
