# SBGP-0016: Establish Ongoing Budget
SolBlaze would like to formally establish a quarterly DAO budget to be maintained on an ongoing basis.

## Proposed Change
Our current DAO budget system consists mainly of various ongoing costs which would require repetitive proposals to maintain. Although one-off costs can be made through individual proposals, the DAO's ongoing budgetary commitments lack consistent funding guarantees. Given that the DAO now has sustainable funding streams consisting of a healthy mix of BLZE and bSOL, we would like to establish a recurring quarterly budget to fund these ongoing expenses.

The most recent DeFi budget (SBGP-0014) allocated 500m BLZE for a three month period. However, due to efficient utilization, we were able to sustain four and a half months of DeFi emissions instead. Looking forward, we request the DAO's approval to allocate up to 400m BLZE + 100 bSOL per quarter to fund DeFi incentives (this bSOL could go towards accumulating more BLZE to use as emissions or could be used for direct incentives). We may very likely end up using significantly less than this amount each quarter (and will ensure that the incentives deployment is both efficient and sustainable), but these numbers are simply an upper bound of how much can be allocated without additional DAO approval.

Also, SBGP-0014 outlined the costs to maintain our Pyth Sponsored Feeds, which many of our DeFi integrations rely on to support our assets. Although the previous proposal already ensured that this allocation would be maintained on an ongoing basis, we would like to reiterate the allocation more formally here. The costs are still being quoted at 100 SOL per year, but as these costs can fluctuate depending on changes on Pyth's end, we request that the DAO allocate enough funds (within a reasonable amount relative to the current quote) solely for ongoing Pyth-related expenses.

Furthermore, Votex has requested that each of their integrated partners (including SolBlaze) contribute $2k per month in order to sustain their operations. In exchange, they will remove their 15% platform fee on the yield for SolBlaze-related deposits, which would boost the vxBLZE APY. We request the DAO's approval to allocate $6k per quarter worth of bSOL to keep our integration funded on Votex as they work to develop a sustainable business model and grow their platform. As early supporters of Votex, the DAO will be rewarded in the future (if and when the time is right).

The DAO continues to sustainably accumulate funds from protocol revenues, so we estimate that we will be able to maintain these ongoing budgetary commitments without any issues, and we will continuously adjust the incentives portion of the budget if we feel that the funding is no longer sustainable.

## Implementation Details

We will coordinate with our partners to ensure the DAO fulfills the relevant budget obligations on an ongoing basis.

## Voting
Yes - the DAO's ongoing budget will be established in accordance with this proposal

No - the DAO's ongoing budget will not be established

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, the DAO's ongoing budget will be established in accordance with this proposal.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
