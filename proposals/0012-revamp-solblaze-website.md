# SBGP-0012: Revamp SolBlaze Website
SolBlaze would like to propose a complete revamp of the SolBlaze website in partnership with [v21 Studio](https://www.v21.studio/).

## Proposed Change
The design of the existing SolBlaze website has been fairly basic, and many people have pointed out over the years that it does not match with the quality that would be expected of a major Solana protocol (especially compared to other protocol websites).

As a result, we are partnering with v21 Studio to perform a full revamp to our SolBlaze website, improving the user flow and bringing the landing page, BlazeStake, and BlazeRewards together under one cohesive website.

In terms of credibility, v21 Studio is a crypto-native design firm who recently completed redesigns for the The Vault and are working on a revamp of Vota and SolanaHub (all of these are SolBlaze partners and heavily BLZE-aligned community members). The team from The Vault shared strongly positive testimonials from their experience. Examples of v21 Studio's work can be found [here](https://www.v21.studio/work) and a showreel can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GldvsEQYt_NzmnAe8xCjLalxAIuhn-5J/view).

The scope of the revamp includes an immersive landing page (animated/parallax), complete revamps of existing pages (stake, DeFi, Custom Liquid Staking, BLZE Gauges), reordering of existing pages (combining BLZE airdrop tracker with the leaderboard), and brand new pages (validators list, resources, native docs).

v21 Studio is ready to get started on Monday, and the estimated timeline is six weeks. In addition to design and front-end code implementation of the previously mentioned pages, the team will touch up our existing logos/branding (keeping the existing familiarity), create a polished branding kit/guidelines (including color palette and typography), design a twitter banner, and create an animated promotional video for the redesign.

The quoted price for this overall scope, given the range of services offered as well as the complexity of the immersive landing page, is $46,250 (50% at project start and 50% at handover).

While the DAO does have some existing bSOL funds, we should accumulate more so that we can pay as much of this amount as possible in bSOL. As a result, we plan to increase the BlazeStake epoch commission to a modest 2% (which is on the low side compared to other pools) and adjust the DAO revenues from BlazeStake to be collected in bSOL instead of BLZE. After we have accumulated enough bSOL to cover the payments, we will switch to a split of 50% bSOL and 50% BLZE for the DAO revenues accumulation from BlazeStake. By our calculations, a 2% commission will still allow us to have a higher APY compared to other providers like JitoSOL and mSOL.

## Implementation Details

$23,125 in USDC-SPL from DAO assets (mostly from the DAO's bSOL holdings) will be sent to the v21 Studio team as part of the initial payment, and they will begin work on the revamp. The epoch commission will be increased from 0% to 2%, and the BlazeStake DAO revenues will be adjusted to accumulate in bSOL instead of BLZE.

## Voting
Yes - an estimated equivalent of $23,125 from DAO assets will be used towards the first payment for the website revamp

No - DAO funds will not be used for the website revamp

## Next Steps
If the proposal passes, we will send the payment to v21 Studio, work with them on the revamp, and adjust commission parameters.

If the proposal fails, SolBlaze will discuss any shortcomings or concerns that caused this proposal to fail, make any necessary revisions, and submit a new proposal to the SolBlaze DAO.
